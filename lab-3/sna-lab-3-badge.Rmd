The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies social network analysis to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, **locate a network study that makes use of group, positional, or egocentric analysis.** You are also welcome to select one of the research papers listed in the [essential readings](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/tree/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-4) that may have piqued your interest.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address and why did they consider these questions important?

    -   

3.  How was group, positional, or egocentric analysis used in this study to address these research questions?

    -   

4.  What were the results of these analyses?

    -   

Think about a network that you are a part of, or may be interested in studying, and answer the following questions:

1.  What is a research question that you might ask about this network that would require group, positional, or egocentric analysis?

    -   

2.  Which approach or approaches would you use to answer this question?

    -   

3.  What measures would you collected as part of your analysis? Why?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

Using one of the datasets provided in the data folder, **create a polished table, chart, and/or sociogram that highlights a network's groups and/or key actors.** For example, you may be interested in examining the characteristics of central actors that emerged in the Massively Open Online Courses for Educators (MOOC-Eds) using `dlt1-edges` and `dlt1-nodes` datasets that were introduced in Learning Lab 2.

**Alternatively, you may use your own data set to explore groups or central actors using the techniques demonstrated in the guided practice.** 

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-3 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share only the code and comments necessary to run and undestand your analysis, then answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE


```

1.  How would you frame a research question that this analysis helps to answer?

    -   

2.  What groups and/or central actors were identified in your analysis?

    -   

3.  How, if at all, might this information be useful for understanding or improving the learning context from which the data was collected?

    -   

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Groups & Egos Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [SNA Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis/discussions/1). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
