## Overview

In Lab 3 we examine the use of different algorithms to analyze a
network's groups, positions and individual actors. The required and
self-selected readings introduce both "top-down" and "bottom-up"
approaches through which groups are identified, as well as ways in which
properties of ego networks are conceptualized and measured. A secondary
goal of readings and discussion is to help you start generating ideas
for independent application of network analysis. As part of our
readings, for example, you'll learn approaches to identifying groups
appropriate to your own research area of interest.

## Readings

For Lab 3, you will read chapters 6 and 7 from [Social Network Analysis
and Education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782)
[@carolan2014] and locate one additional research article, presentation,
or informal study to help address our discussion questions for the week.

### SNA and Education Part II: Methods and Measures

The second half of Part II focuses on ways to partition a network into
groups based on relations rather than on the attributes that one may
share with others. In addition, we learn how a network can also be
divided into distinct positions, i.e. actors who occupy similar
positions have similar relations to others but need not be directly tied
to each other.

    Networks](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n6.xml)

    Analysis](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n7.xml)

## Reflection

To help guide your reflection on the readings, a set of guiding
questions are provided below. After you have had a chance to work
through one or more of the readings, **we encourage you to contribute to
our learning community by creating a new post to our [Social Network
Analysis
Team](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis) on
GitHub**. in response to one or more of the guiding questions, to share
your thoughts .

#### Chapter 6: Groups and Positions in Complete Networks

Consider a network of which you are a part or a network you might be
interested in studying and answer the following questions:

1.  What types of groups and/or unique positions do you think might be
    identified through relational data (e.g., friendships, advice
    seeking, co-authorship, communication, collaboration, etc.)?

2.  How might membership in those groups, or occupying certain
    positions, "influence" attitudes, behaviors, or outcomes for those
    individuals?

3.  How might characteristics or attributes differ between groups or
    positions?

4.  What research question(s) could you explore for this network?

As Carolan notes in Chapter 6, sometimes researchers use a cut-off value
from valued data to identify whether a relationship between two nodes
exists or not before analyzing the data. For example,

1.  How did Daly and Finnagan @daly2011ebb use cut-off values in their
    study and what was the rationale?

2.  What might be some advantages and disadvantages of using cut-off
    values in networks with valued ties?

#### Chapter 7: Measures for Egocentric Network Analysis

Draft a research question for an egocentric analysis of a population you
may be interested in studying, or that would be of interest to
educational researchers.

Share your research question and then answer the following questions:

1.  What methods might you employ to capture egocentric data to address
    this question?

2.  What questions would you ask in order to identify ego's alters?

3.  What other information about the alters might you collected?

4.  What egocentric measures would you use to address your
    question(s)?If a measure of centrality, which might you choose and
    why?
