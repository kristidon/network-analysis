## Overview

Our essential readings for Lab 2 examine common approaches to data
management and measurement in network analysis. The required and
self-selected readings provide an introduction the collection and
management of relational data, as well as how we can begin to describe
what a complete network looks like, not just visually, but
mathematically. A secondary goal of readings and discussion is to help
you start generating ideas for independent application of network
analysis. As part of our readings, for example, you'll learn how to
specify a network "boundary" for your study based on different
approaches.

## Readings

The following readings for this lab focus on issues related to the
collection and measurement of these network variables, including issues
related to boundary specification, sampling, storage, and methodologies.
In addition, the readings introduce important concepts and measures used
to describe static properties of social networks. The conceptual tools
and precise measures help us move beyond basic visualization of
networks, to analysis of networks quantitatively.

## Reflection

To help guide your reflection on the readings, a set of guiding
questions are provided below. After you have had a chance to work
through one or more of the readings, **we encourage you to contribute to
our learning community by creating a new post to our [Social Network
Analysis
Team](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis) on
GitHub**. You post might contain a response to one or more of the
guiding questions, questions you still have about the topics addressed,
or insights gained into your own research.

### Chapter 4: Basic Concepts

Think about a network that you are a part of, or may be interested in
studying, and consider the following questions:

1.  Would your study employs a positional, relational, or event-based
    approach to specify the network's boundary.

    -   

2.  Would you collect data on the complete, ego, or partial network?
    Describe the sources of the network data you might collect.

    -   

3.  What relations would you measure and what instruments might you use
    to measure them?

    -   

4.  How would you help ensure the quality of these relational data in
    terms of validity, reliability, error, and patterns of missingness?Â

### Chapter 5: Structural Measures for Complete Networks

Assume you have complete network-level data on school leaders in a large
urban district that is transitioning to a new teacher-evaluation system.
You have relational data on the frequency with which ego discusses this
new system with each alter (0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = regularly, and
3 = frequently) and whether ego turns to alter for advice regarding
general professional matters (1 = yes, 0 = no).

1.  Which structural properties of the complete network might be of
    interest to you? Please explain why these properties might be of
    interest.

2.  Given the same network described above, what would high
    centralization scores on both relations indicate about this
    network's ability to successfully transition to a new evaluation
    system?

3.  How might your response to #2 differ if you knew that the networks
    also had high density scores? Given this new information, what would
    you predict about the transition to a new evaluation system?
