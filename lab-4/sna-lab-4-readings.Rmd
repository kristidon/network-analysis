## Overview

In Lab 4 we shift our focus from mathematical approaches for describing
networks to statistical approaches for explaining and ultimately
predicting network properties and outcomes for those embedded within
these networks. A secondary goal of readings and discussion is to help
you start generating ideas for independent application of network
analysis. As part of our readings, for example, you'll be introduced to
a range of questions that statistical models for network data can help
answer.

## Readings

The following readings move us beyond techniques introduced in Lab 1 & 2
for describing networks and focus on recent advances in inferential
statistics that can be used to make predictions from social network data
and test hypotheses we have about a network of interest. We'll learn
about different techniques that make use of simulations to model network
data and how these statistical models are used to address questions that
more completely reflect the complexity of educational settings.

## Reflection

To help guide your reflection on the readings, a set of guiding
questions are provided below. After you have had a chance to work
through one or more of the readings, **we encourage you to contribute to
our learning community by creating a new post to our [Social Network
Analysis
Team](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis) on
GitHub**. Your post might contain a response to one or more of the
guiding questions, questions you still have about the topics addressed,
or insights gained into your own research.

### Chapter 8: Statistical Inference With Network Data

-   Why are simulations necessary in order to make probabilistic
    inferences with network data?

-   Explain in plain language how simulations are used to create a
    probability distribution that enables you to make a statistical
    inference with network data.

-   Contrast the aims of the mathematical and statistical approaches to
    social network analysis. For what reasons would educational
    researchers prefer one approach versus the other?

### Chapter 9: Network Data and Statistical Models

Using one of the studies mentioned throughout this chapter, identify the
statistical model that was employed and answer one or more the following
questions:

-   Do you think the choice of statistical model(s) used was
    appropriate?

-   If this same study were to use standard statistical models that
    assume independence among observations, how would this influence the
    study's results?

-   Assume you had network data from an entire high school student body
    (NÂ = 250) and were interested in predicting a student's number of
    friends from covariates such as sex, grade level, and academic
    performance. What model would be most appropriate to test these
    relationships?
