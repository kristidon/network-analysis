The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies social network analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a network study that makes use of statistical models to explain or predict an education related process or outcome.** You are also welcome to select one of the research papers listed in the [essential readings](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/tree/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-4) that may have piqued your interest.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address and why did they consider these questions important?

    -   

3.  What is being modeled to address these questions: ties in complete networks, individual actor attributes, or groups of actors?

    -   

4.  What procedure was used and what, if any, covariates were included in the models?

    -   

5.  What were the results of these analyses and were they "statistically significant"? If so, what does mean in a network context?

    -   

Think about a network that you are a part of, or may be interested in studying, and answer the following questions:

4.  What is a research question that you might ask about this network that a statistical model for networks (e.g. QAP, P\*, ERGM, etc.) might help to address?

    -   

5.  What model would be most appropriate for addressing this question and why?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

In our SNA Lab 4 Case Study, we only scratched the surface on the number of network and node attributes properties that can be tested using ERGMs. Take a look at a [table of common ergm-terms](http://statnet.org/nme/d2-ergmterms.html) or type "ergm-terms" into the help menu of the files pane for some additional examples.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, **your goal for this lab is to extend the ERGM analysis from our case study by adding a new parameter/term to our model.** For example, you may be interested in examining how shared characteristics among school leaders might help explain tie formation, such as gender, level of trust in colleagues, or whether they work at the school or district level.

**Alternatively, you may use your own data set to estimate models akin to those we estimated in the guided practice.** 

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-4 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share only the code and comments necessary to run and undestand your analysis, then answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE


```

1.  What did you predict would be the results of this model?

    -   

2.  What were the actual results of your new model?

    -   

3.  How would you frame a research question that this model helps address?

    -   

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Models & Inference Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [SNA Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis/discussions/1). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
